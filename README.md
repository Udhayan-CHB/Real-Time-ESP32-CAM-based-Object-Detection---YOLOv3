# Real-Time-ESP32-CAM-based-Object-Detection-YOLOv3

# Overview

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using an ESP32-CAM module for video streaming and a YOLOv3 deep learning model for detecting objects. The ESP32-CAM sends video frames over Wi-Fi to a Python script running on a PC, which performs detection using OpenCV** and YOLOv3.

> Ideal for smart surveillance, robotics, IoT-based monitoring systems, or edge-AI prototypes.
